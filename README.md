This is a simple web app built on React and Node.js to visualize your NYT crossword stats over a specified time period. 
You can add users (via their NYT token and user ID - see [instructions](https://xwstats.com/link)) and see their solve times over time, as well as average, fastest, slowest, and median times
in a comparison view with other users. You can also toggle between the mini and normal crosswords.
